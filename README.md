💼 IT Support User Guide Automation – Portfolio Project

This project demonstrates how to test and automate IT support workflows using local documentation files or corporate knowledge bases through Claude Desktop.

The goal is to create a self-contained environment where a user guide (manual, troubleshooting docs, or internal IT support content) can be queried and tested locally or integrated with a corporate knowledge system.

Key highlights:

📂 Local or corporate content testing – validate guides from local files or centralized documentation.

🤖 Automation with Python and Claude Desktop – simulate support queries and generate responses automatically.

💡 Practical IT support scenario – demonstrates knowledge retrieval, workflow testing, and guidance delivery.

🚀 Portfolio-ready showcase – illustrates your skills in Python scripting, automation, and user guidance tools.

This project is ideal for demonstrating how you can bridge IT support content with automated tools to make internal knowledge easily testable and accessible.
